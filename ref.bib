  abstract={This paper presents a means to approximate the dynamic and static equations of stochastic nonlinear systems and to estimate state variables based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). After a nonparametric approximate model of the system is constructed from a priori experiments or simulations, a suboptimal filter is designed based on the upper bound error in approximating the original unknown plant with nonlinear state and output equations. The procedures for both training and state estimation are described along with discussions on approximation error. Nonlinear systems with linear output equations are considered as a special case of the general formulation. Finally, applications of the proposed RBFNN to the state estimation of highly nonlinear systems are presented to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the method.<>},

  abstract={Radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) is powerful computational tools that have been used extensively in the areas of pattern recognition, systems modeling and identification. This paper proposes an adaptive PID control method based on RBF neural network identification. This approach can on-line identify the controlled plant with the RBF neural network identifier and the weights of the adaptive PID controller are adjusted timely based-on the identification of the plant and self-learning capability of RBFNN. Simulation result shows that the proposed controller has the adaptability, strong robustness and satisfactory control performance in the nonlinear and time varying system.},

  abstract = "Various artificial neural networks types are examined and
              compared for the prediction of surface roughness in manufacturing
              technology. The aim of the study is to evaluate different kinds
              of neural networks and observe their performance and
              applicability on the same problem. More specifically,
              feed-forward artificial neural networks are trained with three
              different back propagation algorithms, namely the adaptive back
              propagation algorithm of the steepest descent with the use of
              momentum term, the back propagation Levenberg--Marquardt
              algorithm and the back propagation Bayesian algorithm. Moreover,
              radial basis function neural networks are examined. All the
              aforementioned algorithms are used for the prediction of surface
              roughness in milling, trained with the same input parameters and
              output data so that they can be compared. The advantages and
              disadvantages, in terms of the quality of the results,
              computational cost and time are identified. An algorithm for the
              selection of the spread constant is applied and tests are
              performed for the determination of the neural network with the
              best performance. The finally selected neural networks can
              satisfactorily predict the quality of the manufacturing process
              performed, through simulation and input--output surfaces for
              combinations of the input data, which correspond to milling
              cutting conditions.",

  abstract={A PID control combined with Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network was proposed for course control of ship steering. The traditional PID control has a wide application on ship steering fields because of its simple structure and obvious effect. But uncertainty of ship models and the disturbance of real-world environments reduce its control precision. Neural network has better control effect for such non-linear external disturbance system. Through the ability of the neural network to approximate arbitrary nonlinear to adjusting the PID three parameters in real time to achieve optimum PID control, to overcome the impact due to model uncertainty and disturbance, to achieve the purpose of automatic tracking of ship course. Through the Matlab Simulink environment simulation to verify the control effect of the traditional PID control and the RBF neural network PID control under the sinusoidal reference signal. The comparison of simulation results that PID control that adding neural network can track the reference signal more effectively, so it can achieve more precise control of the ship steering.},
