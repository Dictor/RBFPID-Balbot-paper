그림 \ref{fig:hardware_arch}은 이동식 도립진자 하드웨어의 아키텍처입니다. 이 그림에서 휠 인코더 부분의 경우 하드웨어만 조립되고 실제 사용은 하지 않았습니다. 도립 진자의 각도 오차를 측정하기 위해 9자유도 관성 측정 장치인 MPU9250을 사용했습니다. MPU9250는 각각 3자유도의 가속도, 각속도, 지자계 측정 MEMS 센서를 탑재하고 있습니다. \cite{invensense:mpu9250} 여기서는 가속도, 각속도를 측정 범위(full-scale)를 각각 \(2g\), \(250rad/s\) 및 LPF를 각각 \SI{5.05}{\Hz}, \SI{5}{\Hz}로 설정해 사용했습니다. 신경망과 제어기의 연산을 처리하기 위해 마이크로컨트롤러 STM32L432KC를 사용했습니다. 이 마이크로컨트롤러는 저전력 ARM Cortex-M4 32-bit 아키텍처를 사용하며 100DMIPS 및 64KB SRAM의 준수한 성능을 가지고 있습니다. \cite{st:stm32l432kc} 액추에이터의 경우 정지 전류 약 2A 정도의 감속기 포함 모터 어셈블리인 GB37-520과 이를 제어하기 위한 40V 피크 6A 정격의 H-브릿지 모터 드라이버인 DRV8874를 사용했습니다. \cite{ti:drv8847}

주어진 하드웨어 아키텍처를 부록 \nameref{appendix:schematic}에 나타난 대로 회로를 설계하고 부록 \nameref{appendix:gerber}에 나타난 대로 PCB를 설계하여 제작했습니다. 알루미늄 섀시를 기반으로 진자 역할을 할 철봉을 부착하고 배터리를 장착해 그림 \ref{fig:hardware}과 같이 최종적으로 하드웨어를 제작했습니다.

    \label{fig:software_arch}
\end{figure}
%
그림 \ref{fig:software_arch}은 하드웨어에 탑재된 소프트웨어의 아키텍처를 나타냅니다. 휠 인코더 부분은 초기 설계에만 존재했고 실제 소프트웨어에서 구현되진 않았습니다. MPU9250의 여러 종류의 센서를 융합하여 자세를 산출하기 위해서 Mahony 방향 필터를 사용했습니다. 이 필터는 순간 자세와 각속도 측정에 의해 구동되는 \(SO(3)\)의 관찰자로 명시적 상보 필터를 구현하여 온라인 자이로 편향 및 자세 추정치를 제공합니다. \cite{4608934} PID 제어기와 RBF-NN의 경우 앞서 구현한 RBF 신경망을 기반으로 한 PID 제어기이며 출력 값은 모터 드라이버에 지령으로 전송됩니다.

이때 표 \ref{table:sw_param}에 나타난 \(u_{div}\)를 이용해 제어기에서 출력된 \(u\)를 식 \ref{eq_udiv}와 같이 처리하여 \(u_{motor}\)를 모터 드라이버에 지령으로 내리게 됩니다. \(u_{motor}\)은 \(u_{div}\)를 초과할 수 없습니다.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq_udiv}
    u_{motor} = \frac{u}{u_{div}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{소프트웨어 구현}
%
소프트웨어는 위의 아키텍처대로 Zephyr 실시간 운영체제 위에서 동작합니다. 이 운영체제는 실시간 스케줄링 서비스 및 자료 구조, 하드웨어 드라이버와 추상화 계층 등을 제공합니다. \cite{url:zephyr} 또한 원격에서 소프트웨어의 상태 변수를 수집하기 위해 RF 무선 통신을 이용해 Golang으로 구현된 텔레메트리 소프트웨어를 구현해 사용했습니다. 구현된 소스 코드는 부록 \nameref{appendix:source}에서 수록하고 있습니다.

구현한 실제 하드웨어와 소프트웨어를 통해 시뮬레이션과 동일한 상황을 재현함으로써 검증 실험 진행한 결과, 그림 \ref{fig:gain}과 \ref{fig:ue}와 같은 결과를 얻을 수 있었습니다. 센서의 정확도 한계와 잡음 때문에 \(\alpha_{g}\) 수치가 다르고 \(u_{div}\) 등을 도입하여 다른 경향성을 가진 결과가 도출되었으나 시스템의 출력 상황에 맞게 이득이 조절되고 올바르게 안정 상태를 유지할 수 있음을 확인했습니다.
